## About "How to Build Automated Smoke Tests Using Protractor"
Over the past year, Dale has been working with his team at SCA to build an automated smoke test system that ensures their applications are loading and performing correctly. They built the tests using [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org) and they perform various UI tests that verify the primary functions of the application are performing correctly. The tests run every few minutes and alert them if any issues are found. Dale will be expanding on the lightning talk he gave at the [OKC# March meeting](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/133190313) and will be walking through how to set up Protractor, create the tests, and set them to run automatically.
