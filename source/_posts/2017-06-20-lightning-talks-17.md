## About "Lightning Talks"
Lightning Talks are a really fun event we put on every 3 months. Community members have 5 to 10 minutes to talk about JavaScript or topics related to JavaScript. We give preference to new speakers to strengthen our community. To participate: post your topic and presentation length.

Common talk themes include: problems you've solved, libraries you like, a cool blog post you read, something you're working on now, or pretty much any other way youâ€™re using JavaScript to achieve your goals.

Please note that marketing pitches are not allowed; lightning talks are a community enrichment event.
