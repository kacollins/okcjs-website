## About "WebAssembly"
WebAssembly is an emerging standard which defines a compact, efficient, safe, and portable compiler target for the Web. This talk introduces WebAssembly: what it is and what problems it is designed to solve. Next, an in-depth tour of WebAssembly: how to compile it, what it looks like, how it works, how the engine compiles it into efficient machine code, and how it interfaces with JavaScript. If you care about alternative programming languages, compiling to the Web, performance, or you like using powerful JS libraries and frameworks, come learn
about WebAssembly.
