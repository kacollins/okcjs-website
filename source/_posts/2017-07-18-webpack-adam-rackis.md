## About "Webpack"
This talk will introduce webpack in the most gentle, un-intimidating way possible.  We'll start with no config file, and build the simplest imagineable app.  From that starting point we'll see just how easy it is to add code splitting, chunk management, bundle visualization, and finish with some cool JavaScript toys like Babel and TypeScript.
